It's not the most inviting of options, but the lava to the east and west looks worse. Or you know, you could stay here and wait for the police. Or the grim reaper, whose home you suspect this to be.

You start wondering if this is how a philosopher might feel, if they do, but decide that you'd rather stone instead.
